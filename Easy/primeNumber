// Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself. In other words, prime numbers can't be divided by other numbers than itself or 1.
// For example 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.... are the prime numbers.
// Let's see the prime number program in C++. In this C++ program, we will take an input from the user and check whether the number is prime or not.
// Thank You
